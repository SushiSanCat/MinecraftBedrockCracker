## ‚ùì FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>What does "MCPECracker.exe" do, and why does it require administrator privileges?</strong></summary>
<br>
After clicking "Start Cracking," the tool takes ownership of the `System32` and `SysWOW64` folders, then replaces the `Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.dll` files in both locations with modified versions that bypass the Microsoft Store trial for Minecraft Bedrock Edition.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this a virus or a false positive?</strong></summary>
<br>
As of July 1, 2025, I uploaded `MCPECracker.exe` to VirusTotal. Here are the results:<br>

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Should I back up my original files?</strong></summary>
<br>
Yes! Always back up your original `Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.dll` files from both `System32` and `SysWOW64` before replacing them. This allows you to restore your system if something goes wrong.

# ‚¨áÔ∏è Alternative Method: DLL & Registry File Approach

## How to Use

1. ‚¨áÔ∏è **Download** the files from this repository.
2. üóùÔ∏è **Run** the `InstallTakeOwnership.reg` file to gain necessary permissions.
3. üìÇ **Copy** the provided DLL files:
   - Place the `System32` DLL into `C:\Windows\System32`
   - Place the `SysWOW64` DLL into `C:\Windows\SysWOW64`
4. üéÆ **Launch Minecraft Bedrock Edition** and enjoy!

> **üîí Security Note:**
> After you have finished doing the alternative method, it is strongly recommended to run the `Undo_Take_Ownership.reg` file. This will revert the ownership of `System32` and `SysWOW64` back to the system. Leaving these folders under your user ownership can make your system vulnerable to attacks, viruses, and other malicious activity.
