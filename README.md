> ### Developer Quotes on Piracy & Cracked Minecraft
> **Markus Persson (Notch), creator of Minecraft, on piracy:**
> "Piracy is not theft... There is no such thing as a 'lost sale'."
>
> He also acknowledged that many players start with a cracked version but later become paying customers:
> "A lot of pirates get converted... try-it-before-I-buy-it."

> ### Important Notice About Minecraft Bedrock Cracker 1.21.120+
>
> Minecraft Bedrock Edition switched from UWP (Universal Windows Platform) to GDK (Game Development Kit) in the 1.21.120 update. Source: https://www.minecraft.net/fi-fi/article/minecraft--bedrock-edition-1-21-120
>
> So, around the October–November 2025 timeframe (when 1.21.120 rolled out) is when the switch happened.
>
> This means that MinecraftBedrockCracker will no longer work nor be updated to fix this problem.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>What does "MCPECracker.exe" do, and why does it require administrator privileges?</strong></summary>
<br>
After clicking "Start Cracking," the tool takes ownership of the `System32` and `SysWOW64` folders, then replaces the `Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.dll` files in both locations with modified versions that bypass the Microsoft Store trial for Minecraft Bedrock Edition.

<summary><strong>Is this a virus or a false positive?</strong></summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Should I back up my original files?</strong></summary>
<br>
Yes! Always back up your original `Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.dll` files from both `System32` and `SysWOW64` before replacing them. This allows you to restore your system if something goes wrong.

# ⬇️ Alternative Method: DLL & Registry File Approach

## How to Use

1. ⬇️ **Download** the files from this repository.
2. 🗝️ **Run** the `InstallTakeOwnership.reg` file to gain necessary permissions.
3. 📂 **Copy** the provided DLL files:
   - Place the `System32` DLL into `C:\Windows\System32`
   - Place the `SysWOW64` DLL into `C:\Windows\SysWOW64`
4. 🎮 **Launch Minecraft Bedrock Edition** and enjoy!

> **🔒 Security Note:**
> After you have finished doing the alternative method, it is strongly recommended to run the `Undo_Take_Ownership.reg` file. This will revert the ownership of `System32` and `SysWOW64` back to the system. Leaving these folders under your user ownership can make your system vulnerable to attacks, viruses, and other malicious activity.
